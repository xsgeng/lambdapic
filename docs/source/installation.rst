Installation Guide
==================

System Requirements
-------------------
- Python with headers, tested on 3.12
- GCC >= 9.3 (for building from source)
- Conda (recommended for dependency management)

Installation
--------------------

1. Install prebuilt packages from Conda (recommended)

First install prebuilt packages from conda like mpi4py and h5py which can be difficult to build:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n lambdapic python==3.12 mpi4py h5py numpy scipy
   conda activate lambdapic

2. Install Î»PIC

From PyPI (recommended for most users):

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install lambdapic

From source (for development or custom builds):

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/xsgeng/lambdapic.git
   cd lambdapic
   pip install .

Running Examples
----------------

See :doc:`example`, or use examples from the repo. To run the 2D laser-target example:

.. code-block:: bash

   python example/laser-target.py

These examples demonstrate basic functionality and can be modified for your own simulations.

You can set number of threads via :code:`OMP_NUM_THREADS` and :code:`NUMBA_NUM_THREADS`.

.. code-block:: bash

   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=24
   export NUMBA_NUM_THREADS=24

For MPI run, the number of processes should be equal to the number of NUMA nodes. On Epyc 9004, the number of NUMA nodes is 8 on dual socket nodes.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Slurm, no need to set num threads
   srun -c24 -n8 -u python example/laser-target.py

   # MPICH
   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=24
   export NUMBA_NUM_THREADS=24
   mpiexec -np 8 -ppn 8 python -u example/laser-target.py


Troubleshooting
---------------

- If you encounter build errors, ensure you have GCC 9.3 or newer installed
- For MPI-related issues, verify mpi4py is working in your conda environment
- Building from source requires development headers for Python and MPI
