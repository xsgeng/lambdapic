# Introduction

</div>
位PIC is a callback-centric Particle-In-Cell framework.
It enables the customization of simulation behavior through callbacks at various stages, even when the modifications are unphysical.
The flexibility of 位PIC makes it easy to implement plugins, allowing developers to extend functionality seamlessly without modifying the core simulation logic.
It leverages the `libpic` backend, a Python-based PIC simulation framework available at [libpic](https://github.com/xsgeng/libpic).

## Installation

via pip
```bash
pip install lambdapic
```

via github
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xsgeng/lambdapic.git
cd lambdapic
pip install .
```

## Callback System

Simulation loop stages:

- `start`: Beginning of each timestep
- `maxwell first`: First half of Maxwell solver
- `push position first`: First particle position update
- `interpolator`: Field interpolation
- `push momentum`: Particle momentum update
- `push position second`: Second particle position update
- `current deposition`: Current deposition
- `maxwell second`: Second half of Maxwell solver

Each callback can be attached to any of these stages using the `@callback` decorator.

```python
# laser injector is pre-defined callback
laser = SimpleLaser(
    a0=10,
    w0=5e-6,
    ctau=5e-6
)

# Custom callbacks
@callback()
def energy_sum(sim):
    if sim.itime % 100 != 0:
        return

    total_energy = 0
    for patch in sim.patches:
        # Calculate electromagnetic energy
        ex = patch.fields.ex
        ey = patch.fields.ey
        bz = patch.fields.bz
        energy = 0.5 * (ex**2 + ey**2 + bz**2).sum()
        total_energy += energy
    print(f"Total EM energy: {total_energy}")

@callback(stage="maxwell first")
def mod_ex(sim):
    # Modify fields during the Maxwell solver stage
    for patch in sim.patches:
        patch.fields.ex *= 1.1  # Amplify Ex field by 10%

# Run simulation with callback
sim.run(
    nsteps=1000, 
    callbacks=[
        laser,
        energy_sum,
        mod_ex, 
        callback(stage="start")(lambda sim: print(f"timestep @ {sim.itime} starts")),
        lambda sim: print(f"timestep @ {sim.itime} ends")
    ]
)
```
